<p>The SCM (Senegalese Countercultural Movement) project is dedicated to preserving and sharing the cultural heritage of the countercultural movement that emerged in Senegal during the second half of the 20th century. This movement developed amidst national liberation movements throughout the world, the global student movement, and the Cold War, and was intertwined with clandestine and revolutionary politics in the post-independence period in Senegal.</p>

<p>The countercultural movement in Senegal encompassed a range of initiatives and activities initiated by both women and men. It was a heterogeneous movement, consisting of various organized and unorganized efforts. These initiatives sought to address economic disparities, promote education, raise awareness, and challenge the existing power structures. They aimed to reshape the notion of citizenship and create a new kind of society that was free from imperial influences.</p>

<p>The cultural effervescence within the countercultural movement gave rise to a wide array of creative productions, gatherings, and youth-led initiatives. These included the creation of pamphlets, underground and clandestine periodicals, manifestos, songs, poetry, plays, revolutionary iconography, cassette tapes etc. The materials produced during this time represent a valuable and rare collection of voices and perspectives that provide insights into the socio-political and cultural climate of Senegal and the wider anti-imperial movement.</p>

<p>The SCM project recognizes the importance of preserving these materials as part of Senegal's cultural heritage and seeks to collect a diverse range of items. By collecting and digitizing these materials, the project aims to make them accessible to a wider audience and facilitate research, education, and cultural exchange. The collection encompasses works in African and European languages, reflecting the multicultural and multilingual nature of the countercultural movement.</p>

<p>The SCM project is a platform dedicated to collecting and preserving valuable materials, often found in personal libraries, and which represent a lesser-known aspect of the country's history. The project aims to ensure that future generations have access to this significant part of their national heritage. By safeguarding and sharing these artifacts, the SCM project recognizes their importance and seeks to create a platform for in-depth exploration and study of this historical period.</p></main>
